This RawData folder is to store the raw data that can be 
deleted after use for the fist time. 
Because the raw data will be loaded and saved into the
game world data file.

The published file in format Box2D XML(Beta) is used here.
The advantages are:
	- solving the problem of convex polygon
	- limit the maximum number of vertices per polygon
	in order to match the requirement of Box2D.
-> no need to worry about it. any more. :)
